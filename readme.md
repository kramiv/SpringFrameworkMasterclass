 # This repository contains code from a tutorial I was following along with. It is mostly practice/scrap code, but feel free to look through it regardless.
 
 Still need to see how to set up github in Eclipse so I can upload all relevant files for Maven project.

 Currently about 1/4 of the way through the tutorial I am using.

 SpringExtractFiles contains project files by section/topic

SpringZipFiles can, I think, be imported into Eclipse as a Maven project for section 2. (have not tested it) This is my most complex project in Eclipse. 

note to self: maybe recording a video of functionality would be useful and easier to look at + good for reviewing. 
Not yet though. Want to go through a full example before using these skills to explore a topic/do lab.
